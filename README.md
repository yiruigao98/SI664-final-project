# SI664-final-project
This is the repository for the final project of SI664.

**I will cooperate with Shukai Fan with this project**

In this project, we are going to make a django2 website served as a database for clothing. This website will be well integrated, aiming to create a perfectly organized information center for all the brands/products information about clothing.

This database will be primarily formed as a brand database. The following items are ideas about how we are going to organize this database:

1. Each brand will have attributes including products, categories that products belong to, established date, founder, nationality and major customer gender. 
2. For each founder, there will be a list of brands established by him/her. 
3. For each nationality, there will be a list of brands that belongs to this nation. 
4. For each major customer gender, it will also have a list of brands. The website will also show all products under this gender, where filtering function on brands will be implemented.
5. For each product, it will have attributes including categories (shirts? shorts? etc.), gender (male/female/both), brand and published date.
6. For each category, it will have a list of products, where filtering function on brands/nationality/founder will be implemented.
